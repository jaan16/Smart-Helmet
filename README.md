# Smart Helmet: A Safer, Greener Ride

## Description
This project introduces a smart two-wheeler helmet that integrates two key features:

### Pollution Reduction System (PRS): A filtration system designed to reduce harmful pollutants emitted by two-wheeler vehicles.
### Accident Detection and Alerting System (ADAS): A sensor-based system that detects accidents and sends alerts to emergency contacts.

## Technologies Used
### Hardware:
Arduino UNO
SIM800C GSM/GPRS module
6MV2 GPS module
MPU6050 gyroscope sensor
8018 shock sensor
3.7V 3000mAh rechargeable battery
Filtering materials
DC fan (1.8 â€“ 12V, 2A)

### Software:
Arduino IDE
C++

## Key Features

### Pollution Reduction:
Filters harmful pollutants from exhaust gases
Improves air quality,The helmet's filtration system captures pollutants from the exhaust gases.
A fan draws air through the filter, ensuring efficient filtration.

### Accident Detection and Alerting:
Detects accidents using gyroscope and shock sensors
Sends alerts to emergency contacts via SMS and GPS location
Rechargeable Battery: Powers the system for extended usage,Gyroscope and shock sensors monitor the rider's movements and impact forces.
Upon detecting an accident, the system sends an alert message with GPS location to predefined emergency contacts.

### Real-time Health Monitoring: Incorporate sensors to monitor the rider's vital signs.
Voice Command Integration: Enable voice commands for hands-free operation.
Advanced AI Algorithms: Utilize AI to improve accident detection accuracy and alert response times.
